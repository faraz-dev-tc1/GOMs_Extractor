ABSTRACT
The Andhra Pradesh State and Subordinate Service Rules, 1996 - Amendment
to Rule-22-A(2) relating to 33 1/3% reservation for Women Horizontally in
Direct Recruitment to Public Services - Orders - Issued.
GENERAL ADMINISTRATION(SERVICES-D)DEPARTMENT
G.O.MS.No. 63 Dated: 17-04-2018
R following:-
1. G.O.Ms.No.436, General Administration (Services-D)Department,
Dated: 15.10.1996.
2. G.O.Ms.No.65, General Administration (Services-D)Department,
Dated: 15.02.1997.
3. G.O.Ms.No.40, Dept for Women, Children, Differently Abled &

4. From Secretary, Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission,
TM Lr.No.225/RR/2018 dt:06.04.2018.
\* \* \*
According to sub-rule(2) of Rule 22-A(pertaining to Women
reservation in appointment) of Andhra Pradesh State and Subordinate
Service Rules, 1996 provides for vertical direct recruitment to the posts for
which women and men are equally suited, there shall be reservation to
women to an extent of 33 1/3% of the posts in each category of Open
Competition, Backward Classes (Group-A), Backward Classes (Group-B),
Backward Classes (Group-C), Backward Classes (Group-D), Backward
Classes (Group-E), Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Physically
Handicapped and Ex-servicemen quota.
2. In this connection, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Rajesh Kumar Darla
Vs Rajasthan Public Service Commission held as follows:-
‘Social reservations in favour of SC, ST and OBC under Article
16(4) are ‘vertical reservations’. Special reservations in favour of
physically handicapped, women, etc. under Articles 16(1) or 15(3)
are ‘horizontal reservations”. Where a vertical reservation is made
in favour of a Backward Class under Article 16(4), the candidates
belonging to such Backward Class, may compete for non-reserved
posts and if they are appointed to the non-reserved posts on their
own merit, their number will not be counted against the quota
reserved for the respective Backward Class. Therefore, if the
number of SC candidates, who by their own merit, get selected to
open competition vacancies, equals or even exceeds the
percentage of posts reserved for SC candidates, it cannot be said
that the reservation quota for SCs stood filled. The entire
reservation quota will be intact and available in addition to those
selected under open competition category.
But the said principle applicable to vertical (social)
reservations, will not apply to horizontal (special) reservations.
Where a special reservation for women is provided within the
social reservation for SCs, the proper procedure is first to fill up
the quota for SCs in order of merit and then find out the number
of candidates among them who belong to the special reservation
group of ‘Scheduled Caste Women”. If the number of women in
such list is equal to or more than number of special reservation
quota, then there is no need for further selection towards the
special reservation quota. Only if there is any shortfall, the
requisite number of Scheduled Caste Women shall have to be
taken by deleting the corresponding number of candidates from
the bottom of the list relating to Scheduled Castes’. —
